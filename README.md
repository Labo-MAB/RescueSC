# RescueSC
Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a revolutionary technology which allows to detect gene expression signatures specific to cell types. However, it yields highly complex data and there is no gold standard in how to analyze it. Thus, we developed RescueSC tool, which tackles 3 specific problematic areas in scRNA-seq data secondary analysis:
1. Demultiplexing
2. Quality control (QC)
3. Automating cluster annotation with cell types

The pipeline consists of a number of functions and is generally divided into three parts: RescueTag for demultiplexing; RescueCluster for keeping more biological information during clustering; and AutoClusterType for annotation of clusters with cell types. Here you will find a tutorial on how to analyze your scRNA-seq data with RescueSC.

## Dependencies
In this repository you can find an R file called "Dependencies_for_RescueSC.R". Inside this file there are all the necessary libraries which should be installed before using RescueSC. It is also written how to install the packages, which are not in CRAN. Versions of all the packages and the version of R which was used for the RescueSC development are written in the file as well.
